# mosaic
The mosaic package implements a graph theoretic algorithm that estimates the area of any two-dimensional shape from point data. It includes plot and summary methods and utility functions for generating non-convex hulls around the graphs, random point data, and minimum spanning trees.

The primary function in this package is mgraph, which creates mosaic objects that can be passed to plot.mosaic and summary.mosaic methods. mhull computes non-convex hulls (outlines) around the graphs, and inhull determines which coordinates out of any supplied list fall within the hull. tgraph computes a minimum spanning tree that can also be plotted. mosaic also includes a simple utility function called ptpattern that randomly generates sets of data points falling into a pattern such as a circle or ring.
